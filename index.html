            <strong>Brief Description</strong>: 
            The croissant originated in Austria as a crescent-shaped pastry called the kipferl. 
            The kipferl is thought to have been made as early as the 13th century. 
            The modern croissant is a descendant of the kipferl, but with a lighter, flakier texture.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Origins</strong>: One legend says the kipferl was created in 1683 to celebrate the Austrian victory over the Ottoman Turks at the siege of Vienna. 
            In reality, experts say the kipferl dates back to the 13th century.

            <strong>The Croissant in France</strong>:
            In 1838, Austrian entrepreneur August Zang opened a Viennese-style bakery in Paris.
            His bakery, Boulangerie Viennoise, specialized in kipferls and pain viennois, a Viennese-style sandwich bread.
        </p>

            <strong>Popularity</strong>:
            The croissant became very popular in France after the Exposition Universelle of 1889.
        </p>

            <strong>Recipe Changes</strong>:
            After World War I, the recipe changed to use leavened flaky pastry.

            <strong>The Modern Croissant</strong>:
            Butter from the Poitou-Charentes region of France is often used for croissants because it has a fruitier taste and doesn't melt as quickly.
